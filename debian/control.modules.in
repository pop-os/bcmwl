Description: broadcom-sta modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_)
 Broadcom STA is a binary-only device driver to support the following IEEE
 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network cards: BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-,
 BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43224-, BCM43225-, BCM43227-, and BCM43228-based
 hardware.
 .
 This package contains the set of loadable kernel modules for the broadcom-sta
 wireless network driver. The wireless-tools package is also required in order
 to make use of these modules.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel modules for _KVERS_
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build your
 own broadcom-sta-modules. The broadcom-sta-source package has been provided for
 use with the Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package utilities to produce a
 version of broadcom-sta-modules for your kernel.
